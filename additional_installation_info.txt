Things i had to change from README installation:

-> export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:/include/eigen3/Eigen"
this is the correct eigen path
check echo $CONDA_PREFIX from this the CMAKE_PREFIX should lead to eigen headers

-> cd foundationpose
-> python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
also install these because some are missing in the og file

-> CUDA_HOME=/usr/lib/cuda
-> PATH=$CUDA_HOME/bin:$PATH
-> LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CUDA_HOME/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
only if cuda isnt found


Changed Cuda version to 12.2 - installation with run file
installed drivers manually through sudo apt install
and then runfile without drivers
disabled monitor with sudo systemctl stop gdm
and then ctrl + alt + F3


-> export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH:/usr/include/eigen3:/usr/local/include/eigen3:$CONDA_PREFIX/include/eigen3

-> CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:$CONDA_PREFIX/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pybind11/share/cmake/pybind11 bash foundationpose/build_all_conda.sh
